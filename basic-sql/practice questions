1) Imagine you are a Data Analyst working at CVS Pharmacy, and you had access to pharmacy sales data.

Output the total number of drugs manufactured by Pfizer, and output the total sales for all the Pfizer drugs.

sol:

SELECT count(drug) as count , sum(total_sales) as sum from pharmacy_sales
where manufacturer = 'Pfizer'
group by manufacturer


2) For every FAANG stock in the stock_prices dataset, write a SQL query to find the lowest price each stock ever opened at? Be sure to also order your results by price, in descending order.

sol:

SELECT ticker , MIN(open) as min_open FROM stock_prices
GROUP BY ticker
ORDER BY min_open desc

3) This SQL GROUP BY exercise uses real data from a LinkedIn SQL Interview question which is a bit too hard to tackle right now, so we'll solve an easier variant of the interview question.

Suppose you are given a table of candidates and their skills. How many candidates possess each of the different skills? Sort your answers based on the count of candidates, from highest to lowest.

sol:

SELECT skill , count(skill) as count_min FROM candidates GROUP BY skill ORDER BY count_min DESC;

4) Use SQL's HAVING & MIN commands to find all FAANG stocks whose open share price was always greater than $100.

sol:

SELECT ticker , MIN(open) FROM stock_prices GROUP BY ticker HAVING MIN(open) > 100 ORDER BY MIN(open) desc;
