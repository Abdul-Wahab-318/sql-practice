Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.

sol:

//fancy way

WITH ONE_HOT_ENCODED_CTE as(

  SELECT candidate_id ,
  CASE
    WHEN skill IN ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL') THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END  AS required_skill 
  FROM candidates
)

SELECT candidate_id
FROM ONE_HOT_ENCODED_CTE
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING SUM(required_skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;

//best way
-- SELECT candidate_id 
-- FROM candidates
-- WHERE skill IN ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')
-- GROUP BY candidate_id
-- HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
-- ORDER BY candidate_id;
