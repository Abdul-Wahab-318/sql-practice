Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.

As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

SOL:
SELECT e.employee_id , e.name
FROM employee AS e
INNER JOIN employee as e2
  ON e.manager_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE e.salary > e2.salary
