This is the same question as problem #2 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.

Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.

sol:
SELECT users.city , COUNT(*) as count_ FROM trades JOIN users on users.user_id = trades.user_id
WHERE status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY users.city ORDER BY count_ DESC LIMIT 3;
