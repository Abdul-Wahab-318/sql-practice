Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.

Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table. Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.

If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, they should be assigned the same ranking, and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5). If you've never seen a rank order like this before, do the rank window function tutorial.

sol:
WITH top_10 AS(
  SELECT 
    artist_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER( ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC ) AS artist_rank
  FROM artists
  INNER JOIN songs
    ON artists.artist_id = songs.artist_id
  INNER JOIN global_song_rank
    ON songs.song_id = global_song_rank.song_id
  WHERE global_song_rank.rank <= 10
  GROUP BY artists.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name , artist_rank FROM top_10
WHERE artist_rank <= 5 ;
