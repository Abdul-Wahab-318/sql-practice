Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.
Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

Sol:
SELECT user_id FROM emails JOIN texts ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
WHERE texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed' 
AND EXTRACT( DAY FROM texts.action_date - emails.signup_date ) = 1;
