A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is defined as a customer who has purchased at least one product from every product category listed in the products table.
Write a query that identifies the customer IDs of these Supercloud customers.

sol:
WITH supercloud_cte AS (
  
  SELECT customers.customer_id , COUNT( DISTINCT products.product_category) as product_count
  FROM customer_contracts AS customers
  INNER JOIN products
    ON customers.product_id = products.product_id
  GROUP BY customers.customer_id
)

SELECT customer_id FROM supercloud_cte 
WHERE  product_count = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category ) FROM products)
