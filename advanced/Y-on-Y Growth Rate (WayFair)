Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.

The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

sol:
WITH ordered_transaction AS (
  
  SELECT * , EXTRACT( YEAR FROM transaction_date ) AS year_ ,
  LAG(spend) OVER( PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY transaction_date ) AS prev_year_spend
  FROM user_transactions
  ORDER BY product_id , year_ 

)

SELECT year_ , product_id , spend AS curr_year_spend , prev_year_spend ,
ROUND( (spend - prev_year_spend) / prev_year_spend * 100 , 2 ) AS yoy_rate
FROM ordered_transaction;
